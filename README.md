# Traze
Traze is a multi client online tronlike game with MQTT based protocol. It aims to provide a playground for various game clients, AI game bots, and showcase of a reasonable secure MQTT application, and itâ€™s fun! You can write your own game client and participate in the game using the specified protocol.

## Hosted by iteratec
You can join a hosted instance at [traze.iteratec.de](https://traze.iteratec.de).

## Run a Game locally
You can start a local game using the docker-compose stack provided in this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/iteratec/traze.git
cd traze
sudo docker-compose up
```

This will start a local gameserver, mqtt broker, webui, as well as a couple of bots, binding the following local host ports:

| Service        | Port |
| -------------- | ---- |
| webgrid        | 80   |
| documentation  | 8080 |
| mqtt broker    | 1883 |
| mqtt websocket | 9001 |

You can watch the local game in your browser at http://localhost:80

Bots can be scaled using docker-compose.
```
sudo docker-compose scale random-bot=5
```

## Protocol
The game protocol facilitates multiple MQTT topics with JSON payload. An extensive documentation of the protocol details is provided on [traze.iteratec.de](https://traze.iteratec.de).

## Components
The traze project consists of multiple components. Each component has their own repository and lifecycle. You can find all traze related code under the [traze topic](https://github.com/topics/traze) on github. Some important examples are:
